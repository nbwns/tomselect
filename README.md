# jQuery TomSelect

TomSelect is a jQuery plugin that allows any dropdown to be editable. 

When you applu TomSelect on a dropdown a button "Add" appears next to the dropdown.

Clicking on this "Add" button reveals a text field and a "Save" button.

When clicking on "Save" you can either:

- Trigger some code via a simple callback
- Send a request to an API (if you wanna send the value to a service) 

[Demo on JSFiddle]()

## How to use it ? 

1. Include jquery.tomselect.js in your page (it needs jQuery)
2. Call TomSelect on your dropdowns, like this:

```javascript


```

3. You can provide parameters to customize the buttons and the text field

```javascript

```

4. You can pass a callback that's called when hitting the "Save" button

```javascript

```

5. Or call an API to send the value and fetch the list of values from the API

```javascript

```
